# Challenge 24

## Difficulty

Easy

## Title

Code of the Ancients

## Description

While scanning through fragments of a lost Plumber transmission, Ben discovers another Android app. No alien code, no encryption, nothing flashy.

But Ben’s instincts tell him otherwise. Vilgax is known for tucking away important data where no one bothers to look — the kind of spot even a curious human might ignore.

Something valuable lies within. Will you help Ben dig through the mundane and uncover the truth hidden in the core of this relic?

## Files

- `app.apk`: The Android app file that contains the code and resources for the challenge.

## Solution

Decompile the app using `jadx` and get the flag in `strings.xml` in the resources.

## Flag

```text
cyn0x{n0t_4ll_s3cr3ts_4r3_c0d3d_s0m3_4r3_d3scr1b3d}
```
