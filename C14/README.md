## Title

Pixels of a Tyrant

## Description

While scanning the Plumber archives, Gwen discovered an image file labeled “Do Not View – Level 9 Encryption”. The file? A portrait of Vilgax — glaring, as if he knows you’re watching.

But Grandpa Max always said, _“The more obvious something looks, the more it's hiding.”_ Gwen suspects something is hidden deep within the pixels — something only the smallest bits can reveal.

Can you extract what’s been hidden behind the scowl of this galactic tyrant?

## Files

- `vilgax.png`: Portrait of Vilgax

## Solution

Flag is hidden in the least significant bits of the image.
