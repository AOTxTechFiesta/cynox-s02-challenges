# Challenge 3

## Title

Galvan Gatekeeper Protocol

## Description

Access to a long-forgotten Plumber archive is locked behind what appears to be random numeric junk. But the Galvans never did random â€” every value has its mirror. Rumor has it that two conflicting data streams can unlock the message if you know how to combine them... just like a proper gate key.

## Files

- `secret1.txt` - The first part of the key
- `secret2.txt` - The second part of the key

## Solution

For each numbers in the files, XOR them together. The result is the ASCII value of the flag.

## Flag

```text
cyn0x{x0r3d_truth_fr0m_dual_streams_0f_galvan_crypt0_l0ck}
```
