## Title

Null Void Equalizer

## Description

An old Null Void breach log was recovered, but the data looks… off. According to Azmuth, this format was used by rogue Galvan engineers who believed in **universal equality of data**. No obfuscation, no encryption—just raw transformation. If you treat the contents _equally_, you might see the message they left behind.
