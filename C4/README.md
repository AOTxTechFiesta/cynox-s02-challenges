# Challenge 4

## Title

Echoes of the Null Channel

## Description

Traces of an unusual communication burst were intercepted near the Null Channel anomaly. The signal was distorted, embedded in a format unfamiliar even to Galvan databases. What remains are three distinct readingsâ€”quiet, unassuming, but possibly holding something beneath the surface.

Whatever it is, the message is hidden in plain sight. Can you make sense of it?

## Files

- `secret1.txt` - The first part of the key
- `secret2.txt` - The second part of the key
- `secret3.txt` - The third part of the key

## Solution

For each numbers in the files, concatenate them together. The result is the ASCII value of the flag.
