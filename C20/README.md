# Challenge 20

## Difficulty

Easy

## Title

Keep Out

## Description

Ben’s picked up a strange signal from one of Vilgax’s abandoned command servers. The interface looks simple, almost too simple — like it’s trying to throw him off.

But Ben knows better. He’s seen this trick before.

Some paths are meant to be found. Some secrets are hidden in plain sight, guarded not by lasers, but by instructions meant to scare intruders away. But Ben’s not just any intruder.

Will you help Ben ignore the warning signs and dive into what Vilgax didn’t want anyone — especially search engines — to see?
