## Title

Tetrax’s Terminal Transmission

## Description

Deep within the ruins of a derelict Plumber station, a dormant terminal has come back online, spitting out what seems like total gibberish. But Tetrax insists the device only activates when it detects intelligent life… Maybe the message is meant for someone who can think like a machine. Can you decode what the terminal is trying to say?
