Hidden Entry

## Description

While scanning a rogue satellite transmission, Ben intercepted a digital archive once used by Vilgax to store classified intel on intergalactic tech. Most of the data appears harmless — old reports, research logs, nothing critical.

But Ben can sense it — something's off.

Vilgax doesn't leave things unguarded. Someone has made sure the secret stays buried — someone by the name of itsyourap.

Can you help Ben uncover the buried truth before Vilgax returns?
