# Challenge 5

## Title

Vilgaxian Interference

## Description

During a comms sweep near the debris field of a destroyed Plumber vessel, a corrupted message surfaced. Initial scans show traces of Vilgaxian encryption tampering — an unstable technique he’s been using to twist intercepted transmissions into near-gibberish.

The given file contains the distorted message. Decode it… before he finds out you have it.

## Files

- `secret.txt` - The encoded message

## Solution

Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each character in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. This uses a rotation of 25 characters.
