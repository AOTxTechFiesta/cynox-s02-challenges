Easy

## Title

Echoes of the Null Void

## Description

Ben found this strange audio recording during a recon mission — it sounded like a normal song at first, but Gwen paused.
> “Wait… there’s a pattern. This isn’t just a song — something’s embedded deep in the music,” she said, narrowing her eyes.
The team couldn’t crack it with their ears alone. Maybe you’ll have better luck.
Can you decode the transmission and uncover what the Plumbers couldn't?
